      <p>Hello! Mi name is Ahmed Garcia. I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript and experience working with a wide range of technologies including PostgreSQL, Express, React, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I specialize in building dynamic and interactive web applications, focusing on seamless user experiences and robust back-end systems.<br></br>

My skill set spans across both front-end and back-end development. On the front-end, I leverage React to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces, utilizing modern libraries and frameworks to deliver polished and efficient applications. On the back-end, I have expertise in building RESTful APIs and GraphQL services using Node.js and Express. Iâ€™m proficient in managing databases with both relational systems like PostgreSQL and NoSQL systems like MongoDB, using Mongoose ORM for data modeling.<br></br>

I am experienced in implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT, and I emphasize secure coding practices throughout my work. I have a proven track record of deploying and maintaining applications on platforms like Render and Netlify, ensuring optimal performance and accessibility.<br></br>

Recent projects include a social book review platform where I architected the back-end with GraphQL and JWT authentication, and a progressive web application utilizing service workers and IndexedDB for offline functionality. I am committed to continuous learning and am always eager to take on new challenges, refine my skills, and contribute to innovative projects.</p> {/* Bio */}
